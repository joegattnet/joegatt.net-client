# joegatt.net - client

*This is work in progress - turning [joegatt.net](http://joegatt.net) from a monolythic Rails website to an Angular/RoR pattern. The file structure and apps were seeded from [NG6-starter](https://github.com/angular-class/NG6-starter).*

*A more generic version will be available at [nembrot.org](https://github.com/nembrotorg/nembrot-client).*
